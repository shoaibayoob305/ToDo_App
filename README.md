# ToDo App - Developed by Shoaib Ayoob

Flutter ToDo App developed by Shoaib Ayoob for Unicodesolutions.co

## Project Summary
1. I developed a ToDo application using Flutter, Firebase, and the Hive local database. The app is designed to be smooth, user-friendly, and performance-efficient, focusing on providing an optimal user experience both online and offline.
2. The ToDo items are stored in the Hive local database for offline access. I implemented a background synchronization feature that syncs the local data with Firebase every 6 hours, ensuring data consistency and minimizing server load.
3. The app supports both Arabic and English languages. I utilized Flutter's localization framework to handle text, layout direction, and other language-specific elements, ensuring a seamless experience for users in both languages.
4. The app includes eye-catching animations designed to enhance user engagement while maintaining a strong focus on memory management to prevent leaks. These animations are implemented using Flutter's animation framework, tailored to provide a smooth and fluid experience.
5. I employed a clean architecture pattern, emphasizing code readability, scalability, and maintainability. The codebase is well-commented to facilitate understanding and future development. I also ensured the application of SOLID principles throughout the project.
6. I utilized the Riverpod state management library to handle the appâ€™s state, ensuring efficient management of complex app states and a reactive user interface.
7. Comprehensive integration tests were written to cover all core features and use cases. These tests ensure that the app's functionalities perform as expected under various conditions.
8. While I primarily focused on custom development for the main features, I did incorporate select open-source packages where appropriate to enhance functionality and efficiency without compromising the integrity of the project.
9. Where AI-generated code was used, I thoroughly reviewed, tested, and validated it to ensure it met the project's standards and requirements.
10. The project is delivered as a fully functional, well-documented, and scalable ToDo application, ready for deployment. The code is hosted on GitHub and is accessible via the provided repository link.
